# üå∏ Flower Classification using CNN & Transfer Learning

This project builds a deep learning model to classify flower images into multiple categories using a real-world dataset. It demonstrates both a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a transfer learning approach using **MobileNetV2** to achieve higher accuracy.

## üìå Problem Statement

The objective is to classify images of flowers into predefined categories by building an image classification model. The dataset consists of real-world images with varying lighting, background, and orientation conditions, making it a challenging multi-class classification task.

## üß† Models Used

### 1. **Custom CNN**
- Designed a CNN architecture with convolutional, max-pooling, dropout, and dense layers.
- Applied regularization techniques including dropout, early stopping, and batch normalization.
- Achieved validation accuracy of **68%** after tuning and augmentation.

### 2. **Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2)**
- Utilized pretrained **MobileNetV2** from TensorFlow Keras Applications.
- Fine-tuned the model on our flower dataset.
- Achieved validation accuracy of **88%**.
